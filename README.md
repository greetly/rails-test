# Greetly Ruby on Rails Test

## Instructions
1. [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) and clone this repository **X**
2. Complete "Requirements" **X**
3. For a big plus, deploy to a free Heroku container **Keep in mind that you will need to update Rails and use a PostgreSQL db instead**


## Requirements
Update the existing code to provide the following functionality:

1. Add ability to set a due date on a Task **X**
2. Add ability to sort Tasks by due date **X**
3. Update the ListsController so that every action responds to JSON **X**
4. Apply Bootstrap [CSS](http://getbootstrap.com/css/) and [components](http://getbootstrap.com/components/) to make the UI more appealing **X**

These updates should be **_all your own work_**, and it does not need to be complicated.  Fewer tested features are preferred over many buggy features.

**Good luck!**
